# React | Flickr

- This react app is a Flickr clone which consumes Flickr API.

- You can search groups, and see the image collection of a particular group.

- This app also shows the pie chart comparison of image count of groups.

- React.JS with Context API State management is used on the frontend along with Materialize CSS as the UI and HighCharts.JS for the data visualization.

- Images are lazily loaded via Infinite Scroll, 20 at a time.


- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
